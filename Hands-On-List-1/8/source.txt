The Beach House,
The sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, casting long shadows across the deserted beach. I stood at the water's edge, the cool sand beneath my feet. 
It had been a tumultuous year. I'd lost my job, broken up with my partner, and felt like I was drowning in a sea of uncertainty.
I remembered the old beach house my grandmother used to take me to as a child. 
With a newfound determination, I decided to pack my bags and head to the beach house.
